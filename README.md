# Deep Compressive Sensing in Caffe
Collection of source code fore deep learning based compressive sensing in Caffe. 

### Disclaimer 
All tools are actually reimplemented with some improvements as
1. For ReconNet and DR2Net: 
- Implemented as fully-convolutional network
- Generated files with pycaffe (train, test, solver - prototxt as well as train.sh).
- Data generation is added: sampling matrices, separate training data for different subrate, more test data, etc. 
- General test framework: applied for both ReconNet and DR2Net
2. For CSNet 
Note that I use same hyper-parameters as the original implementation.

### Collection Tools
1. ReconNet [1]
2. DR2Net [2]
3. DAMP [3]
4. CSNet[4]
